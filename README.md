# kratos-react

Just playing around with [ORY Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos) and react.

How to run:

1. start Kratos and friends with `docker-compose up`
2. start react app in `./web-app` directory with `npm start`
3. use `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`

Kratos setup is mainly based on the [quick start](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart).


What works:
* sign up
* login
* logout
* settings
* fetching current user

Todo:
* recovery flow
* email verification flow
* some social login
